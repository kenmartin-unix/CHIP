focal and bwbasic are binary executable files.

The 'tar' files should be brought down and untarred using

tar -xvf filename.tar

cd filename

make

sudo make install


If you want the source code and documentation and examples. If
you only want to execute the programs bring down the binary files.

In the folder you will find DOC's and Example programs.

The file startvnc is a simple script if you use VNC. It will
fire it up. If it was already running it will be restarted.
From the P.C./MAC side fire up the vncviewer and set the
